## A React-based interface application designed to display the functionality of a server.

To run the interface, follow these steps:

1. Open your console/terminal and navigate to the project directory on your computer where you have saved it, specifically in the \AirportSimulation\Interface folder.

2. Enter the following command:

### `npm i`
### `npm start`

3. This will automatically open the interface in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually open it by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
